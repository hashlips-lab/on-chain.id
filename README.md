# On-Chain.ID
Take back control over **your own** data, on-chain.

## Disclaimer
This project is an MVP submitted to the "Keep it Confidential: The Sapphire
Hackathon" event by the [OASIS Network](https://oasisprotocol.org/). The goal of
the event is to promote the development of new applications on their
revolutionary new EVM-compatible chain.

On-Chain.ID is only available on Testnet and **we don't recommend using it on
production** until it's released as a stable service on Mainnet. We also
recommend **not to use real sensitive data** when testing it before the release.

## About 
The On-Chain.ID project is about storing personal data on-chain with the option
to allow access to third-party providers in a safe way and without
intermediaries.

Web3 brands and communities are constantly looking for easy, secure and
affordable ways to verify the ownership of an ETH address from other web2
services.  
A quick example: community managers on Discord know the name of each user on
their server, but how can they connect those names to ETH addresses to
verify token ownership?

As of today, people are using third-party services like CollabLand, but this way
they are relying on an external provider that interacts with their users, it
stores the data and manages it for them.

On-Chain.ID offers an on-chain solution to this problem and, thanks to the
Sapphire network, data can stay in the hands of users while also being
cross-chain compatible with any EVM chain out there.

## Testnet version
Our MVP is currently available at https://testnet.on-chain.id, please make sure
to use your MetaMask wallet and also to be connected to the [Sapphire
ParaTime Testnet](https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/sapphire/#testnet). (Support for
other wallets will be available in the future)
